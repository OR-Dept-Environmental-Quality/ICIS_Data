# ICIS_Data
Code to transform data pulls from ICIS into format conducive to RPA 

This code is designed to take a specifically designed data pull (DMRAlianaDataPull_TrialFeature Report) from EPA's ICIS database and compile the data into a format that is easy to use for NPDES RPAs. 

The data is output in an excel file containing multiple sheets designed to display summary data for Chlorine, pH, and ammonia RPAs, as well as a sheet that shows 
combined summary statistics for all parameters and a sheet that shows the original data from the ICIS data pull.
